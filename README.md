A Python Repository on Discrete Mathematics Introductory topics. 

`Discrete mathematics` is a branch of mathematics that deals with __objects that can assume only discrete values__, such as integers, graphs, and logical statements. It is a fundamental area of mathematics that is used in computer science, engineering, and other fields that involve discrete structures and processes. Here are some key concepts in discrete mathematics for beginners:

-  [x] [Logic](/MathNotebooks/Logic.ipynb): The study of reasoning and arguments, including propositional logic, predicate logic, and the principles of proof. 
-  [x] [Set Theory](/MathNotebooks/SetTheory.ipynb): The study of sets, including set operations, relations, and functions.
-  [x] [Combinatorics](/MathNotebooks/Combinatorics.ipynb): The study of counting and arranging elements, including permutations, combinations, and probability.
-  [x] [Graph theory](/MathNotebooks/GraphTheory.ipynb): The study of graphs, including connectivity, paths, cycles, and graph algorithms.
-  [x] [Number theory](/MathNotebooks/NumberTheory.ipynb): The study of the properties and behavior of integers, including divisibility, modular arithmetic, and number-theoretic algorithms.
-  [x] [Algebraic Structures](/MathNotebooks/AlgebraicStructures.ipynb): The study of algebraic systems like groups, rings, and fields.
-  [x] [Recursion](/MathNotebooks/Recursion.ipynb): The study of recurrence relations and recursive algorithms.
-  [x] [Relations and function](/MathNotebooks/Relations&Functions.ipynb)s: properties of relations and functions, such as injectivity, surjectivity, and inverse functions.

These concepts form the foundation for more advanced topics in discrete mathematics, such as algorithms, automata, and complexity theory.
